# SAE §4a — Exact-marginal cycle (EMC): tempered posterior-marginalized training with a semi-Markov reverse model

## State

Active: nothing launched. Phase registered 2026-09-15 from the revised method note; literature in
`reports/lit_method_v2_2026-09-15.md`, reusable artifacts in `reports/SAE_setup_report_2026-09-15.md`, project
evidence in `reports/sae_failure_evidence_for_method_v2.md`, design review (DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, all five ranked
changes folded in below) in `reports/design_review_4a_2026-09-15.md`.
NEXT: implementer builds S0a (reverse model + prior + the S1a read job) to the spec in "Stages"; code-reviewer
checks it; S1a runs on CPU before lattice code exists. S0b (lattice, recognizer, train step, eval path) follows.
Live pids / watcher: none.

## Objective

Decide, with plain PER and WER, whether the exact-marginal cycle objective

    L_tau(x) = -log sum_pi [ q_theta(pi | x) * P_psi(B(pi))^beta * p_phi(z | B(pi), eta) ]^(1/tau)

(CTC recognizer q over 50 Hz wav2vec2-L15 frames; frozen phone m-gram P_psi over phonemized text; segmental
reverse model p_phi predicting the 50 Hz K=500 unit stream z from the transcript with per-token duration and a
frozen speaker embedding eta; everything marginalized exactly by DP) does three things this project's earlier
objectives did not:

1. **Its reverse term aligns with phonetic truth on this bed.** §1a's Gaussian HSMM from an oracle init raised
   its likelihood while PER went 0.275 -> 0.392 (`SAE_1a.md:102-106`); §1f's statistics matcher preferred a
   content-free decoy on all five configurations (`SAE_1f.md:682-687`). S1 measures whether log p_phi and PER
   move together here, with phi refit per condition.
2. **Refines the best label-free start instead of degrading it.** The GRPO loop from theta_0^G ended 4.9/6.2 WER
   worse than its own init after eight legs (`SAE_3E1.md:1300-1311`). S2 reads PER/WER per sub-epoch from a
   GAN-lineage init under L_tau, with and without an anchor to that init.
3. **Bootstraps from a flat start** with deterministic annealing (S3). Literature ceiling for the non-adversarial
   family is 33-49 TIMIT PER against 12-22 for GANs (`reports/lit_method_v2_2026-09-15.md`, Q1); nobody has
   executed the exact-lattice form (Q8; Yang/Schlueter/Ney ICASSP 2026 propose it without experiments).

Not an objective of this phase: excluding private codes. User ruling (2026-09-15): avoid collapse to a useful
degree; WER speaks; analysis gates control spend only.

## Design decisions (deltas from the method note, with the evidence behind each)

- **Phone-level, no LLM anywhere.** Text side = T_phi (`TextToPhonemeJob.THKMON3k9LJQ`, 39 ARPAbet + SIL), the
  same text side as the §1c GAN. The "no G2P anywhere" ruling (`SAE_ref.md:159-172`) scopes the orthographic
  LLM reward and lists the §1c/§1d phone pipeline as allowed; §4a is that kind of track.
- **Observation = 50 Hz enc50 units, K=500** (codebook `QuantizeStatesJob.FWpGhC941JMi`; frozen raw store
  `PackUnitsJob.I0uzRMfUrKWC`, the store the §3g scorer consumed, `SAE_3E1.md:109`). Categorical targets keep
  acoustic and prior scales within one order (§1a's PCA-48 Gaussian density drowned the prior: "O(few) nats
  against O(d*frames)", `SAE_1a.md:76-79`). The 500-way codebook's discriminability is load-bearing
  (`SAE_1f.md:537-539`); K=4000 is a later ablation.
  Reverse clock: 50 Hz, so that d_min = 2 means 40 ms. The §3a finding that the 50 Hz store never won an eta
  comparison against subsampled stores (`SAE_3A.md:260-262`) argues for a 25 Hz reverse clock at a quarter of
  the DP cost, but d_min = 2 at 25 Hz is 80 ms, above the median phone; 25 Hz with d_min = 2 is therefore an
  ablation, not the primary, and the d_min rule is not relaxed.
- **Reverse model = the §3a `psi_align` forward-sum machinery** (one state per token, exact log-space forward,
  K=500 categorical, d_min=2, ~11 M params, `SAE_3A.md:31-37`) modified to the method: explicit categorical
  duration p(d | k) with 2 <= d <= D_k (D=25 frames for phones, D_sil=50, SIL may repeat), emissions
  nu_phi(k, d, r, eta) that depend on within-segment position r and a frozen speaker embedding eta, no left
  phonetic context in the first build. It sees no recognizer posterior, hidden state or CTC path.
- **Speaker embedding eta** = PCA-16 of the utterance-mean L15 features, fitted once on train-clean-100, frozen.
  Label-free, cannot be trained into a content channel; carries at most a bag-of-units summary, disclosed.
  §3g found duration, then speaker, were what its scorer learned instead of content (`SAE_3G.md:472-478`);
  giving the reverse model eta removes the incentive to encode speaker in the symbols.
- **Recognizer** = frozen wav2vec2-lv60 L15 features (50 Hz, 1024-d) + a small trainable network (the w2v-U 2.0
  generator shape: 1-2 conv layers over PCA-512 features, blank + 41 outputs), T = S = 50 Hz. The GAN-lineage
  init is built by CTC on the frozen §1d pseudo-labels (`GanPseudoLabelJob.xjn6QnNqwEEH`, 28,539 utts).
  **Registered decision (2026-09-15):** the "GAN/§1d output as initialization only" carve-out (`SAE.md:32-36`)
  is G-track-scoped (`config_sae_3d_gtrack_v1.py:17-20`); §4a extends it to this phase under the same
  restriction (never in-loop teacher, reward or selection signal) and discloses it as the init's provenance.
- **Prior order**: bigram first (M = 84 states, ~2e9 ops per 10 s utterance, 9 MB forward table), trigram as
  the first S2 ablation. This is a cost ordering, not a claim that a bigram suffices: Nuhn 2013 reports the
  trigram optimum 38 % wrong at cipher length 32 and 5 % at 128, with no bigram row; our utterances average
  ~125 phones, and the acoustic term does most of the work. SIL inserted at word boundaries with p_sil = 0.5,
  the §1c value (`FairseqPreprocessTextJob.bi2B89fES77z`), so the GAN comparison shares its text side.
- **Band W = 25 frames (0.5 s)**; single-clock variant is an ablation only.
- **Temperature and anchoring**: S2 arm A runs at fixed tau = 2 (exact-posterior point). Plain deterministic
  annealing discards a good initializer (Smith & Eisner 2004), and soft EM from a good init is exactly the §1a
  setting that drifted, so S2 arm B is init-anchored: the summand carries an extra factor q_init(pi)^alpha
  (the skew posterior of skewed annealing; per-frame, so it is one added log-prob per arc), alpha decaying
  1 -> 0 over sub-epochs 1-4. tau = 1.5 is the sharpening ablation. S3 (flat start) anneals tau 8 -> 2.
  tau = 1 (mode / Viterbi training) is not run.
- **Corpus-level term** L_agg = KL(c_text || c_hat) over phone unigrams and bigrams under q, one small
  lambda_agg fixed for both S2 arms (swept only as an ablation, 100 h bed only, `SAE.md:47-50`). It is a
  collapse guard, not an anchor: §1f showed low-order matching cannot separate truth from a matched-length
  decoy (`SAE_1f.md:682-687`).
- **Rate**: d_min = 2 and D_sil = 50 bound the token count only weakly. The emitted phone rate is logged per
  sub-epoch; a sub-epoch whose rate leaves [0.6, 1.5] x the text phone rate (9.8/9.4 per s on dev,
  `SAE_1f.md:533-536`) is reverted, not compounded (wav2vec-U 2.0 reports PER > 100 whenever the rate drifts).
- **Not built in this phase**: back-translation (a permutation code is bidirectionally consistent; the
  unit-collage inputs are off-distribution), Wasserstein-Procrustes init (§1f: observable-graph PMI rank
  correlation 0.373/0.370 between a 0.214/0.216 floor and a 0.413/0.398 ceiling, `SAE_1f.md:524-525`, predicts
  a near-random map), unsupervised-boundary restriction (REBORN Table 4: external boundaries hurt). Each is a
  named follow-up, funded only if S2 or S3 shows a live objective.

## Gates (loose by ruling; originals kept, amendments marked)

- **G4a.1 S1a reverse-term alignment (analysis, spend control only).** Quantity: held-out log p_phi(z | y, eta)
  per frame, with phi REFIT on each condition's transcripts (the prior is reported beside it, never inside it,
  because permuting phone rows makes -log P_psi worse by construction). Conditions: gold; kappa-corrupted maps
  for kappa in {0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0}; speaker-and-length-matched derangement; text-unigram draws at matched
  length; one constant fluent string. Pass = monotone in kappa and gold ahead of every null on the paired
  per-utterance read. If it fails AND S1b loses more than 0.05 absolute PER within two sub-epochs, S2 waits for a
  reverse-model redesign; otherwise S2 runs regardless and WER decides.
- **G4a.2 S2 refinement (WER speaks).** Gated quantity: dev-other sclite WER of the reported checkpoint (last,
  and the unsupervised-selected one), lexicon + official 4-gram flashlight decode with the decoder parameters
  pinned to the §1d decode's values (read from `Wav2Vec2KenlmDecodeJob.AQw3EcUo6rks`), as a paired per-utterance
  delta against the arm's own init with a clustered-bootstrap CI. "Refines" = CI excludes 0 in the arm's favour.
  "Usable" = matches or beats §1d (17.96 / 21.87). PER (per-frame argmax, collapse, drop SIL, no LM) reported
  beside it. The selection formula (held-out L_2 + LM NLL of decodes + vocabulary usage + un-normalized length,
  Baevski's full recipe) is pre-registered in the selection job's docstring before the first checkpoint exists.
  A degrading run is reverted, not compounded (`SAE.md:173-175`). Never best-PER.
- **G4a.3 S3 cold start (bet).** Read at the END of the anneal (sub-epoch 4, tau = 2), not earlier: continue only
  if dev-other PER < 0.50 with a positive speaker-matched derangement gap; otherwise the cold-start route closes
  with the family behaviour recorded.

## Stages

**S0a Reverse side (implementer; code-reviewer before S1a).** `speech_llm/sae/emc/reverse.py` (psi_align-derived
segmental model with duration and position-dependent emissions and eta; test: forward-sum equals brute-force
enumeration on 8 small (S, U) shapes, d_min = 2 respected, likelihood finite on the sufficient statistics),
`prior.py` (phone m-gram from T_phi with SIL insertion; bigram and trigram), `speaker.py` (PCA-16 of
utterance-mean L15), and the S1a read job (`S1aReverseLadderJob`, CPU, 500 dev-clean + 500 dev-other MFA-gold
utterances, refit per condition, paired output json, convention printed by the job).

**S1a Training-free alignment read.** Runs as soon as S0a passes review. Numbers go to Results before S0b is
reviewed; they do not block S0b's implementation.

**S0b Lattice and training (implementer; code-reviewer before any GPU).** `lattice.py`: banded forward AND
manual backward in the log semiring over (t, s, h, f) with the three transitions of the method note; autograd
is the test oracle on tiny shapes only (the expanded per-step transition tensor is ~4.4e6 floats; autograd
would save it T times, ~9 GB per utterance). `agg.py` (expected m-gram counts over the CTC topology),
`train_steps/sae_emc.py`, recognizer init jobs (i) CTC-distill on §1d pseudo-labels with its PER read,
(ii) flat, (iii) quarantined oracle init (CTC on the 2849-utt seed dir
`TransformAndMapHuggingFaceDatasetJob.mQmb6aW1IDH5`, S1b only). Eval path: pure-torch greedy PER job; posterior
dump -> lexicon + 4-gram flashlight decode -> sclite, matching `Wav2Vec2KenlmDecodeJob.AQw3EcUo6rks` (all 2703 /
2864 utterances, zero empty). Wall time projected from the first 100 measured steps of the real job.

**S1b Oracle drift (quarantined diagnostic).** Init (iii) + L_2 training on train-clean-100, two sub-epochs, PER
per sub-epoch. §1a's row is the comparison. Artifacts never feed the ladder.

**S2 GAN-lineage refinement (main, 100 h bed, train-clean-100, 6 sub-epochs of ~7.1k utts).** Reverse-model
warm-up: one sub-epoch of phi on the init recognizer's tempered posterior, theta frozen. Then arm A (tau = 2,
unanchored) and arm B (tau = 2, init-anchored, alpha 1 -> 0), bigram, W = 25, beta = 1, one lambda_agg. Per
sub-epoch: PER, WER, phone rate, distinct-string count, derangement gap. Ablations only if an arm refines:
trigram; tau = 1.5; single-clock; lambda_agg sweep; 25 Hz reverse clock; K = 4000.

**S3 Flat start (one or two runs).** Random phi, zero logits, tau annealed 8 -> 2 over sub-epochs 1-4,
lambda_agg from S2, same reads, gate read at sub-epoch 4.

## Standing constraints carried

d_min >= 2 (`SAE_3E1.md:161`); labels never train or select in S2/S3, S1 is a quarantined diagnostic; paired
reads and plain sclite WER (`SAE.md:40-45`); lambdas per bed, sweep at 100 h; no replay data in any phi refit;
unsupervised checkpoint selection by the pre-registered formula; token-rate revert rule above.

## Verifier feedback

- 2026-09-15 design review (`reports/design_review_4a_2026-09-15.md`): G4a.1 moved from -log R to the refit
  reverse term; S2 arm B anchored; manual backward required; S0 split so S1a precedes the lattice; G4a.2
  quantity, selection pre-registration, G4a.3 timing and the rate revert added; four citations corrected.
