calc_search_error:
- build eval config which does search on a given dataset and collects scores of best sequences
- build forward config which feeds ground-truth alignment through model and collects scores of given seqs
- compare scores inside config and calculate search errors
- dump search errors into hdf file

compare_aligns:
- directly use local job to load specific seqs from hdf files and plots

dump_/plot_attention_weights:
- dump attention weights into hdf file and then load in local job to plot

dump_alignment_from_txt_new:
- build config with ExternSprintDataset to load alignment cache and dump into hdf
