This folder contains Sisyphus configs for the results in the paper "Label-Context-Dependent Internal Language Model Estimation for CTC" at INTERSPEECH 2025. Please see the `READEME.md` under `users/phan` for instructions on reproducing the results.

The configs `table12.py` and `table3.py` reproduce the results in Table 1+2 and Table 3 respectively by running configs inside the `backup/` folder. Each config inside `backup/` runs the ILM training and recognition for each type of ILM.
