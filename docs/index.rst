This is the documentation of the public pipeline of the RWTH i6 lab for the

For the software toolkits used in the pipeline refer to `RASR <https://github.com/rwth-i6/rasr>`_ and `RETURNN <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn>`_.

The repository is still under construction, so please wait for any updates to the source code and the documentation.
