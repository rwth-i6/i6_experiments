# Example Setups

This folder contains ready-to-use recipe setups.
They should not be loaded and executed from this folder, but copied either under your user folder (for i6-people) or into a new recipe folder (for people outside i6).

**WARNING:** Please be aware that code here might change, so really do not rely on the stability of anything.
Always make a full copy for yourself when using an example setup.

## Contributing

A setup needs to be self-containing with all code except code in i6_core or i6_experiments/common.
Example setups should not import from other setups, and use only relative imports for modules within the baseline.
